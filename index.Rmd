## My meme

My meme is based on the honey badger, a tough fearless animal from Africa. Cats have the attitudes of honey badgers but they lack the skills and abilities to back this up. So I think it's funny to put them together. There are three characters in my meme, a honey badger, a typical cat and another cat who tells the fact.

## My animated GIF

Slam Dunk was an important anime in 1990's. I used to watch this on TV when I was a kid.  Recently Slam Dunk was rebooted with a new movie. Creating a GIF about this is topical. I selected the images of the five main characters in the anime and showing their names on the images.
